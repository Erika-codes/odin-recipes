# odin-recipes
This project is to create a recipe website using the basic HTML skills learned in Foundations. The skills I have demonstrated in this project are:

Formatting the HTML boilerplate
Adding a title
Adding headings
Adding internal links (AKA relative links)
Adding images
Adding paragraphs
Adding lists, both ordered and unordered

And, as a side note, learning git was rather confusing for me at first. I read some additional online resources and I practiced entering commands into terminal until I grasped the concept. I have a much better understanding of it now.
